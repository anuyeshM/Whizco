Welcome to our free Instagram rate calculator! This tool allows you to easily calculate the rate of your Instagram account based on your number of followers, engagement rate, and the type of content you post.

Using our calculator is simple: just enter your Instagram handle, select your content category (such as fashion, travel, or beauty), and input your average number of likes and comments per post. Our calculator will then use this information to estimate your rate per post, making it easier for you to negotiate with brands and businesses for sponsored content.
